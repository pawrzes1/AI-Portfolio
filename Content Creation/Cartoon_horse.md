üåô Fluffy's Dreamy Meadow
Once upon a time, in a soft, sunlit valley, there lived a little horse named Fluffy.
Fluffy had the softest, shiniest coat you could ever imagine ‚Äî it sparkled in the morning dew like tiny stars.
Every day, Fluffy loved to trot through the meadows, chasing butterflies and nibbling on sweet clover.

But tonight was special.
As the sun slowly dipped behind the hills, painting the sky with pinks and golds, Fluffy yawned a big, happy yawn.
It was time for his Evening Adventure ‚Äî the one he only went on in his dreams.

Fluffy closed his eyes and with a gentle whoosh! he found himself trotting on a path made of clouds.
The stars twinkled all around, lighting the way.
Along the cloud-path, Fluffy met friendly dream-creatures: a giggling owl, a sleepy bunny, and a family of fireflies who danced just for him.

"Come with us!" the fireflies chimed.
They led Fluffy to a magical glade, where the grass glowed softly and the trees whispered lullabies.

Fluffy twirled and pranced, feeling lighter than a feather.
He laughed and laughed ‚Äî a quiet, tinkling sound that made even the stars smile.

At last, the sleepy bunny hopped up to Fluffy and said,
"It‚Äôs time to rest, little one. Even the dreams need to sleep."

So Fluffy curled up on a fluffy cloud, the stars tucking him in with their golden light.
He gave one last happy sigh, and drifted into the sweetest, deepest sleep.

And there he stayed, cozy and calm, until the morning sun kissed the valley once more.

The End.
